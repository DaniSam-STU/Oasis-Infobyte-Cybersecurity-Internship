## Case Study: Stuxnet and USB Propagation 
While primarily known as a cyberweapon, Stuxnet's initial infection vector involved USB baiting. Infected USB drives were strategically dropped near nuclear facilities in Iran, where curious employees picked them up and plugged them into secure systems. This physical social engineering bypassed air-gapped security measures.

**Prevention Strategies**
- Device Control: Block unauthorized USB devices
- Policy Enforcement: Clear rules about external media
- Awareness Training: "Don't plug it in" campaigns
- Technical Solutions: Auto-run disablement, endpoint protection
