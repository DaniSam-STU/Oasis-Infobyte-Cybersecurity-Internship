# **🔐 Task 4: Research Report on Common Network Security Threats**

## **📌 Overview**
This repository contains the complete research report for **Task 4** of the **Oasis Infobyte Cybersecurity Internship**. The report provides an in-depth analysis of common network security threats, including **Denial-of-Service (DoS)**, **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)**, and **Spoofing** attacks. Each threat is examined with real-world examples, impacts, and practical mitigation strategies.

## **🎯 Key Takeaways**
- **DoS/DDoS:** Overwhelm systems with traffic; mitigated with filtering, scaling, and DDoS protection services.
- **MITM:** Intercept communications; prevented with encryption, VPNs, and certificate validation.
- **Spoofing:** Masquerade as trusted entities; countered with DNSSEC, email authentication, and network monitoring.
- **Holistic Security:** A layered approach combining technology, policies, and user awareness is essential.
